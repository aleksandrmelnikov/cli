# cli

## Getting Started

First, run the `init` command. This will generate a sample configuration file.
At the moment, you must fill out the `manifestsRepo` key. 
This should be the directory where you have `onepanel/manifests`

You can then modify the generated `params.env` file with arguments you want.
